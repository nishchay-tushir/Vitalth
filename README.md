# IOT-based-Stress-Analysis
Stress has a massive impact on physical and mental 
health, including the risk of chronic diseases and psychological issues. 
This research paper proposes a novel combinational approach to 
stress detection using wearable sensors (watches) and combining 
these physical signals with psychological signals. The proposed study 
includes sentimental analysis on voice-converted text data to 
enhance stress detection accuracy. The approach uses the 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) to analyze text data and determine the emotional 
tone or sentiment present in a sentence. The results produced from 
sentimental analysis using a machine learning model are then 
combined with the physical parameters of the user to produce more 
accurate and effective results. This data is then recorded for a long 
duration of time and then presented in the form of graphs for a better 
classification of the stress level of the user. The research aims to 
provide an effective and new way of stress detection that can help 
individuals manage their stress levels.
